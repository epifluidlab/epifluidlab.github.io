## Research Directions

<br><br>

- Understanding the heterogeneity of cfDNA, exosome and its related cell types

- Profiling multi-dimensional -omics simultaneously in cfDNA and its related cell types

- Exploring genetic variant effects on epigenetics, and therefore phenotypes in pathological conditions
