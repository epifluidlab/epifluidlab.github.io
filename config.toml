Specifically, we would like to extract genetic and multi-dimensional epigenetic information in circulating cell-free DNA, exosomes and its related cell types to explore the role of epigenetics in gene regulation at the population level and therefore bridge the gap between genetic and phenotypic variations at different healthy and pathological conditions. Our ultimate goal is pan-disease early diagnosis"
