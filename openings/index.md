#### Post Doctoral Researcher (Computational)

The new research fellow/associate is going to work on our own single-molecule and single-cell multi-omics technologies, integrate multi-omics signals from the same single cell, and finally understand the regulatory roles of non-coding genetics variants in the heterogenous cellular system. Details in [Nature Career](https://www.nature.com/naturecareers/job/762196)

- Highly motivated in scientific research.
- Ph.D. (recent/expected) in computational biology, bioinformatics, genomics or quantitative research fields.
- Proficiency with at least one high-level scripting language (R or Python) and Linux operating system (Bash).
- Excellent quantitative background in statistics and machine learning, and/or computational genomics background. Familiarity with large-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis (WGS, WGBS, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and/or related) and/or single-cell multi-omics.
- At least one decent first or co-first author SCI paper published or accepted.
- Fluent in English (spoken and written).

#### Post Doctoral Researcher (Experimental)

- Highly motivated in scientific research.
- Ph.D. (recent/expected) in epigenetics/epigenomics, genetics/genomics, immunology or liquid biopsy.
- Familiar with basic molecular biology techniques (PCR, qPCR, mammalian cell culture) and NGS library preparation (WGS, WGBS, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and/or related). It will be better to have the experience in FACS sorting, single-cell -omics and/or liquid biopsy.
- At least one decent first or co-first author SCI paper published or accepted.
- Fluent in English (spoken and written).

#### Graduate Students
Graduate students will be recruited through [BMI](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/b/bmi/education), [MDB](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/education/research/molecular-developmental-biology), and [Immunology](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/education/research/immunobiology-grad) graduate programs in CCHMC or other graduate programs in University of Cincinnati. Students who are interested in our research are welcome to contact Dr. Liu before their application.

#### Undergraduate and Highschool Students
Undergraduate and highschool students who are interested in our research are welcome to contact Dr. Liu directly for the intern.
