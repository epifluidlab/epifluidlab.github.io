# WELCOME TO [THE EPIFLUID LAB](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/h/genetics/labs/liu)

We are epigenomics and computational biology lab within the [Division of Human Genetics](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/h/genetics/labs) and [Biomedical Informatics](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/b/bmi/team) in the Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and also part of the Department of Pediatrics in [University of Cincinnati College of Medicine](https://med.uc.edu/landing-pages/faculty-profile). The research focus of our lab is on developing and applying computational and experimental multi-omic methods to understand the gene regulation of non-coding genetic variants. Specifically, we would like to utilize multi-dimensional epigenomics signals within the single cells and that from circulating cell-free DNA (outside cells) to dissect the functional roles of non-coding regulatory elements and therefore bridge the gaps between genetic variations and phenotypic variations at different physiological and pathological conditions.
