# WELCOME TO [THE EPIFLUID LAB](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=60180)

We are epigenomics and computational biology lab within the [Simpson Querrey Institute for Epigenetics](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/epigenetics/index.html), [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/biochem/index.html), and [Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/) at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Our long-term research interest is to decode the human genome. The recent research focus of my lab is on developing and applying computational and high-throughput experimental methods in epigenomics to understand the gene regulatory roles of non-coding genetic variants in different pathological conditions, including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we focused on the computational method development for circulating cell-free DNA fragmentation and new biotechnology development for the joint profiling of multi-omics within the same single cells, which will eventually enable biomarker discovery for the early diagnosis and prognosis of many complex diseases.
