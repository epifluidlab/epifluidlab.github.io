  description: We collected thousands of uniformly processed and curated de-identified cfDNA WGS datasets across different pathological conditions. FinaleDB comes with a fragmentation genome browser, from which users can seamlessly integrate thousands of other omics data in different cell types to experience a comprehensive view of both gene-regulatory landscape and cfDNA fragmentation patterns.

  subtitle: De novo characterization of cell-free DNA fragmentation hotspots

  description: We developed an approach to de novo characterize the cfDNA fragmentation hotspots from whole-genome sequencing. In healthy, cfDNA fragmentation hotspots are highly enriched in gene-regulatory elements, especially open chromatin regions from hematopoietic cells. The results highlight the significance of de novo characterizing the cell-free DNA fragmentation hotspots for detecting early-stage cancers and dissection of gene-regulatory aberrations in cancers.
